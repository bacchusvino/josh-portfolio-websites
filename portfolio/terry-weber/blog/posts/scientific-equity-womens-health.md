# Why Scientific Equity in Women's Health Is 50 Years Overdue

Women make up 51% of the population but account for only 22% of clinical trial participants in cardiovascular research. That single statistic explains why heart disease—the leading cause of death for American women—is still routinely misdiagnosed in emergency rooms across the country.

This isn't a minor oversight. It's a systemic failure that has been compounding for half a century.

## The Origin of the Gap

In 1977, the FDA issued guidelines excluding women of "childbearing potential" from early-phase clinical trials. The intention was protective. The result was catastrophic.

For the next 16 years, medical research was conducted almost exclusively on male subjects. Drugs were tested on men. Dosages were calibrated for men. Symptoms were documented based on how men presented.

It took until 1993—1993—for Congress to mandate women's inclusion in NIH-funded research. And even now, three decades later, we're still playing catch-up.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Consider what the research gap has produced:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Women are 50% more likely to be initially misdiagnosed with a heart attack. Why? Because "classic" symptoms like crushing chest pain are based on male presentation. Women often experience fatigue, nausea, and jaw pain—symptoms still dismissed as anxiety or stress.

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Women suffer from autoimmune conditions at 2-3 times the rate of men. Yet funding for autoimmune research represents less than 3% of the NIH budget.

- **Depression**: Twice as common in women, but most antidepressant efficacy data still skews male.

- **Hormone therapy**: Decades of stigma and underfunding despite clear evidence of benefits—because women's hormonal health wasn't considered a serious research priority.

## Why This Matters Now

I spent six years at Biote Medical confronting this reality every day. Hormone optimization therapy had been helping patients for decades, but without institutional support to build the evidence base.

The medical establishment dismissed it because the studies weren't there. The studies weren't there because no one funded them. No one funded them because women's health wasn't considered worthy of investment.

We changed that. We funded the research. We published the evidence. We built the clinical infrastructure that the field had been denied for years.

Not because it was easy—it wasn't. Because the alternative was continuing to fail millions of women who deserved better.

## What Needs to Change

Scientific equity requires more than checking a box on trial enrollment. It demands:

**1. Sex-disaggregated data as standard practice.** Every study. Every drug. Every device. Analyze outcomes by sex, not as an afterthought, but as a core requirement.

**2. Funding mechanisms that prioritize understudied conditions.** Autoimmune diseases, endometriosis, menopause-related conditions—these need dedicated research dollars proportional to their impact.

**3. Medical education reform.** Teach providers to recognize sex-based differences in disease presentation. A woman having a heart attack shouldn't die because her symptoms don't match a textbook written about men.

**4. Cultural shift.** Stop dismissing women's symptoms as "hormonal" or "psychological." Start treating them as legitimate medical concerns requiring investigation.

## The Business Case

For those who need a commercial rationale: women make 80% of healthcare decisions for their families. They control $10 trillion in consumer spending in the United States alone. Companies that solve women's health problems well will dominate their markets.

But more importantly, this is simply the right thing to do.

Medicine exists to help people. Half of those people are women. It's long past time we designed our research—and our treatments—with that basic fact in mind.
