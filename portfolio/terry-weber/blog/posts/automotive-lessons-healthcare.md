# What Automotive Taught Me About Reinventing Healthcare

Before I ran healthcare companies, I ran automotive dealerships. When I made the transition, everyone thought I was crazy. "What does selling cars have to do with medicine?"

More than you'd think. And the lessons from one of America's oldest retail industries helped me transform some of its newest healthcare organizations.

## The Unexpected Connection

Automotive dealerships are high-volume, multi-product, service-intensive businesses that live or die on customer experience and operational efficiency.

Substitute "clinic" for "dealership" and "patient" for "customer," and you've described most healthcare organizations.

Both industries have:
- Complex service delivery with multiple touchpoints
- High emotional stakes for customers
- Technical expertise that customers can't easily evaluate
- Trust as the core currency
- Massive operational complexity behind the scenes

The difference? Automotive figured out operational excellence decades ago. Healthcare is still catching up.

## Lesson 1: Measure Everything That Matters

Walk into any successful automotive dealership and you'll find dashboards everywhere. Sales per employee. Service bay utilization. Customer satisfaction scores. Time to close. Gross margin by product line. Every metric that drives profitability and customer experience is tracked daily, discussed daily, improved daily.

When I arrived at my first healthcare organization, I asked for similar dashboards.

The response: confused looks.

Clinical outcomes were tracked—eventually, through slow chart reviews. Financial results came monthly. Patient satisfaction was surveyed occasionally. Nobody could tell me, in real-time, how the business was performing.

We changed that. We built operational dashboards tracking patient flow, provider productivity, satisfaction scores, and clinical outcomes—updated daily. The visibility alone drove improvement. When people can see how they're doing, they naturally want to do better.

## Lesson 2: Customer Experience Is the Product

In automotive retail, we understood that buying a car is emotional. It's often the second-largest purchase people make. A great experience creates loyalty; a poor one creates enemies who tell everyone they know.

Healthcare is even more emotional. Patients are scared, vulnerable, often in pain.

And yet, healthcare has historically designed experiences around provider convenience, not patient needs. Long waits. Confusing processes. Impersonal interactions. Surprise bills. Cold waiting rooms with outdated magazines. Forms that ask the same questions three times.

We've normalized experiences that would be unacceptable in any other industry.

At Amen Clinics and Biote, we redesigned patient journeys from scratch:

- What does the patient feel at each touchpoint?
- Where are the friction points?
- What information do they need, and when do they need it?
- How do we make them feel cared for, not processed?

Simple changes—pre-appointment calls, comfortable environments, clear pricing, follow-up check-ins—transformed patient satisfaction and referral rates. None of this required new technology or massive investment. Just attention to experience.

## Lesson 3: Train Like You Mean It

Automotive manufacturers invest heavily in training. They understand that the person at the dealership IS the brand to the customer. Every interaction shapes perception. Every touchpoint matters.

Healthcare training often focuses narrowly on clinical skills. Providers learn medicine. Support staff learn systems. But patients interact with everyone: front desk, medical assistants, billing coordinators, schedulers.

Each person shapes the patient experience, yet most receive minimal training on service, communication, or empathy.

We built comprehensive training programs that went beyond clinical competence. We taught patient communication, conflict resolution, brand standards. We trained everyone—not just providers—to see themselves as caregivers.

The results were immediate. When your front desk understands they're the first point of care, not just administrative gatekeepers, everything changes.

## Lesson 4: Standardize the Mundane, Personalize the Meaningful

Great dealerships standardize processes that should be consistent—paperwork flow, service scheduling, inventory management—so they can focus energy on what matters: the customer relationship.

Healthcare often does the opposite.

Administrative processes vary chaotically by location and person, creating errors and inefficiency. Meanwhile, clinical care becomes standardized to the point of feeling robotic. Patients become protocol numbers rather than people.

We flipped this model. We built standard operating procedures for administrative and operational functions—one way to do it, the right way, everywhere. This freed providers and staff to spend their energy where it actually mattered: connecting with patients, understanding their needs, personalizing their care.

## Lesson 5: Challenge "How We've Always Done It"

Automotive retail went through massive disruption. The internet killed information asymmetry—customers now know dealer cost before walking in the door. Tesla reimagined the dealership model entirely. Digital tools transformed every aspect of the business.

The survivors learned to question every assumption about how cars should be sold and serviced.

Healthcare is in the early stages of similar disruption. Telehealth. AI diagnostics. Retail clinics. Direct primary care. Consumer-grade health monitoring. The old models are being challenged from every direction.

Organizations that cling to "how we've always done it" will be replaced by those willing to reimagine care delivery from first principles.

Coming from outside healthcare was an advantage. I didn't know what we were "supposed" to do—only what made sense for patients and for the business. Sometimes that meant challenging sacred cows and weathering pushback from people who insisted change was impossible.

It was always worth it.

## The Bigger Picture

Healthcare isn't selling cars, and I would never diminish the profound importance of what clinicians do.

But operational excellence isn't about treating patients like customers in a trivializing sense. It's about recognizing that patients deserve the same thoughtful attention to experience, efficiency, and outcomes that well-run businesses in any industry provide.

The tools of operational management—measurement, process design, training, continuous improvement—aren't foreign to medicine's values. They're expressions of those values: caring enough about patients to constantly get better at serving them.

Cross-industry experience isn't a liability. It's a lens that reveals what insiders can no longer see.
